# Google Sheets as CMS with React

There was an article on freecodecamp about using Google Sheets to build a basic CMS:

This repo is for playing and testing of this. I've also noticed that this can be used as a simple DB.

## Notes:
- Super simple to setup and get running
- App Script is JavaScript. Is cloud-based. Not run by the browser, so unable to use document and HTML methods or classes
- Can be used as a DB, but not scalable

## Tools
- React
- Axios, SASS
- Google Sheets
