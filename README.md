# Google Sheets as CMS with React

There was an article on freecodecamp about using Google Sheets to build a basic CMS:

This repo is for playing and testing of this. I've also noticed that this can be used as a simple DB.

## Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Super simple to setup and get running</li>
  <li>App Script is JavaScript. Is cloud-based. Not run by the browser, so unable to use document and HTML methods or classes</li>
  <li>Can be used as a DB, but not scalable</li>
</ul>

## Tools
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Axios, SASS</li>
  <li>Google Sheets</li>
</ul>
